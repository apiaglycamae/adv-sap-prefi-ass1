## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-It is a technology that helps the developer build software using common interface standards and patterns, allowing them to be quickly integrated into new applications to promote reusability to ensure that the requirements are met.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-The first characteristic of SOA is the Standardized Service contract whose goal is to promote and express the features of their services, Next is the Loose Coupling which can minimize the dependencies between services, Next is Abstraction this characteristic is about hiding their details from the outside world, Service Reusability it contains services that can be reused  in the future, Autonomy this service should self-contain or independent about other services, Statelessness is about minimizing the service to enhance the performance and scalability of a service, Discoverability it provide explicable information about their capabilities, Composability services that can be reused in multiple solutions and lastly is Interoperability is about sharing data in other services.
3. Define Microservices.
-Microservices is about dividing large services into smaller services and each part has its own responsibility.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Microservices allow organizations to create small, cross-functional teams for agile operations, increasing agility that a single feature team can build, test, and deploy it. 
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-The difference between SOA and Microservices is that the SOA service is reusable and shared in enterprises, while microservices is their services for individual that function independently. Their similarities is both Microservices and service-oriented architecture (SOA) enable development teams to create, implement, and maintain new cloud applications with efficiency.
